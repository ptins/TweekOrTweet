## TweekOrTweet

SocialSensing Project

The goal of this project is to determine an individual's 'likability' by perusing their social media, namely their Twitter account.

## Steps

### Step 1 - Determine How to Calculate Likability

Likability goes two ways: what you broadcast, and what others broadcoast about you.

The first prong is what you broadcast, namely tweets, and for each tweet we have:
- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ]

Additionally, your profile is also something you broadcast.
- [ ] 'location': 'New York, New York'
- [ ] 'description': 'astrophysicist'
- [ ] 'followers_count': 50486064
- [ ] 'friends_count': 7800
- [ ] 'listed_count': 68034
- [ ] 'favourites_count': 69
- [ ] 'statuses_count': 10474
- [ ] Various other profile_image/_link/_panel features
